🧠 MIKA — Governed Cognitive AI Agent

A locally hosted, governed cognitive AI system designed to reason, remember, and extend its own capabilities under explicit, immutable rules.

MIKA is built as a private, offline-capable AI agent that prioritizes control, transparency, and human authority, while still allowing advanced behaviors such as tool creation and neural-network building in sandboxed environments.

✨ Features

🛡 Governor-based control model (immutable rules, enforced at runtime)

🧠 Persistent memory with importance weighting

❤️ Emotion & feedback loop for behavioral adaptation

🪞 Internal monologue (private reasoning layer)

🧩 Capability-based learning (tools & models, not self-rewriting)

🧪 Sandboxed execution for experiments and training

🖥 Fully local / offline-capable

🔍 Full auditability of decisions and actions

🧭 Design Philosophy

MIKA is not a self-modifying AI.

Instead, it follows a parent–child governance model:

The Governor defines non-negotiable boundaries

MIKA may explore, learn, and build within those boundaries

Authority remains human-held at all times
